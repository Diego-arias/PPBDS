# I get annoyed at checking in a libs/ folder everywhere, but you do need one in docs/.
# Or maybe we should check them in? If you don't, then, unless you have built the html

# We need the _book_temp_files/ in docs/. I don't think that it matters that these
# files are not pushed for each chapter. Might need to revisit this if we start cache'ing
# results so that the book builds faster.
